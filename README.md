## Let's Chat

Live demo: https://zoom-clone-webapp.netlify.app/

Full-stack Zoom Clone, live video chat app that is built using the following:
* React
* Material-UI
* NodeJS
* Express
* Socket.IO (WebSockets)
* PeerJS (WebRTC)

Implemented Socket.IO and PeerJS for real time video streaming. 

### Steps to use:
1. Allow the browser to access your webcam and microphone
2. Type in a username
3. Copy your user id
4. Send your user id to a friend
5. Have your friend enter your user id and press call
6. Wait for the call notification to appear on your browser
7. Accept his call and start chatting :smile:

Note: There might be some bugs as I'm still learning about WebSockets and webRTC :sweat_smile:
